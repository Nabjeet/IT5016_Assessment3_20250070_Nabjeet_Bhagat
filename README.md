#Overview 

My IT5016 Assessment 3 repo is here. Here’s how I used Python to build a ferry booking system. In the interest of indicating what role each piece played, and the programming principle I tried to use them for, I went ahead and commented all my code as well. Doing this assignment taught me how classes and methods work, as well as structuring your code. 

#Contents of the repository 

My primary code is Own_Code/booking_system. py. The user is asked to enter the approval of management, details of service, and data for passengers. It also shows some stats and final booking information. 

Practice_Code- (If you want) Code that I battled and played with before writing my own application. 

Notes/principles. md- Simple tutorial of what I have learned about programming. 

#Principles of Programming I Attempted to Utilize 

Extracting 

Here: "I put all info about the passengers and bookings into one class." 

Improvement: "Secure and admin-friendly software due to entrapment of booking data and passenger information at the same place. In its absence, it is possible to inadvertently modify or confuse information. 

Modularity 

Now: “Every function should have exactly one responsibility.” 

Better: “Because now I only need to edit one method instead of the whole program if approval is going to work differently.” This cuts down on errors and time. 

Readability 

Now: "To help others understand, I added docstrings and comments." 

Better: "Readability is important because it enables other developers-if not yourself in the future-to quickly understand the code. Without the comments, you'd have a harder time reading that code. 

Handling Errors 

Now: "What I found is that we need to consider wrong inputs." 

Best: "Program crashes are prevented through error handling. For example, even if the user types characters instead of a number, the app still works. This makes it more reliable for real users. 

 

 

#What I Discovered 

Found out how to: Do methods and make a python class in working on this project. 

Keep everything in functions to avoid ugly code. 

Explain in comments what I’m doing. 

Think about how others will read my code. 

Even as a beginner, apply programming principles of modularity and encapsulation. 

#How to Run This Project 

Clone the repository. 

Navigate to the Own_Code directory. 

Type python booking_system. py to launch the application. 

Adding passenger information, service details and approval If this process can be completed in stages follow by instruction. 

Meanwhile on terminating the program, it will show the stats and booking data. 

 

 

#conclusion 

With this project, I could study design basics and practice Python programming. I also learned how to log what all I am doing and organize my files in a repository. This homework was a good start, but I realize how much I don’t yet know.  how much I don’t yet know.
