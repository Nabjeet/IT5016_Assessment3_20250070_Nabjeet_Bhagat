#Summary

My IT5016 Assessment 3 repo is here. Here’s how I used Python to build a ferry booking system. In the interest of indicating what role each piece played, and the programming principle I tried to use them for, I went ahead and commented all my code as well. Doing this assignment taught me how classes and methods work, as well as structuring your code.

#Contents of the repository

My primary code is Own_Code/booking_system. py. The user is asked to enter the approval of management, details of service, and data for passengers. It also shows some stats and final booking information.

Practice_Code- (If you want) Code that I battled and played with before writing my own application.

Notes/principles. md- Simple tutorial of what I have learned about programming.

#Principles of Programming I Attempted to Utilize

Encapsulation: I encapsulated all booking and passenger data inside a class. This is for the sake of data coherency.

Modularization: I implemented separate designs to present statistics, site description, endorsement, customer and service information. Every function does one thing.

Readability: I added docstrings and comments so that others will be able to know what every function does.

Maintainable: Somebody tried to write some code that was easy to change. For example, the approval process is placed in a separate function and ticket ID is automatically generated.

Error Handling: I found out that you need to account for wrong inputs, so like entering letters in places you should be putting numbers. To do that I added some basic handling.

#What I Discovered

Found out how to: Do methods, and make a python class in working on this project.

Keep everything in functions to avoid ugly code.

Explain in comments what I’m doing.

Think about how others will read my code.

Even as a beginner, apply programming principles of modularity and encapsulation.

#How to Run This Project

Clone the repository.

Navigate to the Own_Code directory.

Type python booking_system. py to launch the application.

Adding passenger information, service details and approval If this process can be completed in stages follow by instruction.

Meanwhile on terminating the program, it will show the stats and booking data.

#conclusion

With this project, I could study design basics and practice Python programming. I also learned how to log what all I am doing and organize my files in a repository. This homework was a good start, but I realize how much I don’t yet know.
